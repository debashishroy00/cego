"""
Quick Wins Optimizer - Phase 1 of CEGO implementation.

This optimizer provides immediate token reduction (20-30%) using simple but effective
techniques: duplicate removal, semantic deduplication, and chunk overlap removal.
These optimizations require minimal complexity and provide guaranteed value.

Target: 20-30% token reduction with maintained accuracy
Fallback: Always available if advanced optimizers fail
